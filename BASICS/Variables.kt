// All pograms need to able to store data, and variable help you to do just that. In Kotlin, you 
// can declare:

    - Read-only variable with val 
    - Mutable variables with var

// TO assign a value, use the assignment operator.
//For example:

    val popcorn = 5 //There are 5 boxes of popcorn 
    val hotdog = 7 // There are 7 hotdogs 
    val customer = 10 // There are 20 customers in the queue 

    //Some customers leave the queue
    customers = 8 
    print(customers)
    // 8 

//As a customers is a mutable variable, its a value can be reassigned after declaration.
